//! The timeline view: layout, interaction handling, and edit-request events.
//!
//! [`TimelineView`] is the top-level widget. It is generic over the app's
//! [`TimelineDataSource`] implementation and owns a [`TimelineState`] for
//! view-local state (zoom, scroll, playhead, selection).
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! ```text
//! ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
//! │ ruler (timecode ticks, work-area band, markers)      │
//! ├─────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────┤
//! │ track   │  clip area (per-track rows)                │
//! │ headers │   ┌──────┐   ┌─────────┐                   │
//! │  V1     │   │ clip │   │ clip    │        ┆ playhead │
//! │  V2     │        ┌──────────┐            ┆          │
//! │  A1     │   ┌─────────┐                 ┆          │
//! ├─────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────┤
//! │ horizontal scrollbar                                 │
//! └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! The ruler is painted by [`TimelineRuler`](super::TimelineRuler), headers
//! by [`TrackHeader`](super::TrackHeader), clips by
//! [`ClipElement`](super::ClipElement), and the playhead by
//! [`PlayheadElement`](super::PlayheadElement). The clip area lays out one
//! row per track from the data source, sized and stacked purely from
//! [`TrackData::height`](super::TrackData::height).
//!
//! # Interactions
//!
//! * **Ruler click** — seek: moves the playhead to the pointed frame
//!   (through [`TimelineState::set_playhead`]) and emits
//!   [`TimelineEvent::PlayheadChanged`].
//! * **Clip drag** — move: horizontal motion shifts the clip in time;
//!   vertical motion across a track boundary requests a cross-track move
//!   (never onto a locked track). While dragging, the clip snaps to nearby
//!   snap points (clip edges, playhead, work-area edges, markers) when
//!   [`TimelineState::snap_enabled`]. On mouse-up the widget emits
//!   [`TimelineEvent::ClipMoveRequested`]; the host expands the request to
//!   the clip's transitive [`ClipData::linked_ids`](super::ClipData::linked_ids)
//!   group — and the widget does not change anything itself.
//! * **Clip edge drag** — trim: the ~6 px hit zones at each clip edge start
//!   a trim gesture. Emits [`TimelineEvent::ClipTrimRequested`]; the host
//!   expands the request to linked clips and adjusts `media_in` for
//!   [`TrimEdge::Start`].
//! * **Marquee** — rubber-band selection: dragging on empty clip-area space
//!   draws a selection rect; on release the hit clips go through
//!   [`TimelineState::select_range`] and [`TimelineEvent::SelectionChanged`]
//!   is emitted.
//! * **Scroll wheel** — horizontal pan; **ctrl-scroll / pinch** — zoom
//!   anchored at the cursor via [`TimelineState::set_zoom`], emitting
//!   [`TimelineEvent::ZoomChanged`].
//! * **Header separator drag** — track height resize, emitting
//!   [`TimelineEvent::TrackHeightChanged`].
//!
//! # Edit model (read this before wiring events)
//!
//! The widget **never mutates the model**. Every gesture ends in a
//! [`TimelineEvent`] describing the requested edit. The host applies it
//! through its engine and undo stack — keeping the engine the single source
//! of truth — and then calls `cx.notify()` on the data-source entity, which
//! makes the view re-read and repaint. If the engine rejects the edit
//! (locked track, collision, …), simply don't notify and the gesture has no
//! visible effect.
