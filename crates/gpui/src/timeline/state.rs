//! Pure view-state for the timeline: zoom, scroll, playhead, selection.
//!
//! [`TimelineState`] holds no [`Entity`](crate::Entity) handles and no model
//! references — it is plain data with pure methods, which makes it the
//! unit-testable core of the widget. [`TimelineView`](super::TimelineView)
//! owns one of these and funnels every interaction through it.
//!
//! # Coordinate model
//!
//! The clip area uses a single affine mapping between sequence frames and
//! pixels, parameterized by `zoom` (pixels per frame) and `scroll_offset`
//! (the content position currently at the top-left of the viewport):
//!
//! ```text
//! screen_x(frame) = frame * zoom - scroll_offset.x
//! frame_at(x)     = (x + scroll_offset.x) / zoom
//! ```
//!
//! [`TimelineState::frame_at_point`] and [`TimelineState::point_at_frame`]
//! are exact inverses (up to float rounding and frame truncation) and both
//! are implemented here — they are the contract the painter and the mouse
//! handlers share.
