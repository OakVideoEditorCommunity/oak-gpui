//! Frame-exact time types for the timeline widget.
//!
//! The timeline's canonical time unit is the **frame**, expressed as an
//! [`i64`] inside [`Frame`]. Durations and positions are never stored as
//! floating-point seconds: floats drift and accumulate rounding error, which
//! is unacceptable for an editing tool where an off-by-one frame is a visible
//! bug. The only place seconds appear is at the edges of the system —
//! converting wall-clock playback time into frames (see
//! [`super::playhead::PlayheadTicker`]) and formatting human-readable labels
//! via [`format_timecode`].
//!
//! This mirrors the Oak engine's time model, where canonical time is a
//! rational `int64 num/den` and the ABI exchanges `int64` frame timestamps
//! together with a per-sequence [`FrameRate`] such as `30000/1001`.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! * A [`FrameRate`] is always normalized to a positive, non-zero numerator
//!   and denominator by [`FrameRate::new`].
//! * All conversions that produce frames from floats round deterministically;
//!   see [`seconds_to_frame`] for the exact rounding policy.
//! * [`FrameRange`] is half-open: `[start, end)`.
